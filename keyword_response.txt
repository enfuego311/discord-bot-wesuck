ff2::The thing about civilization is that we are all 72 hours away from pure cannibalistic anarchy. That clock gets reset everytime we eat, everytiem we sleep but all of life as know it are on a precipice. FF2 was about 48 hrs for me. Everything you know and care about means nothing. That's the reality of culture and civilzation. It's an absolute cosmic shadow held up by essentially nothing. Final fantasy 2 taught me that.
